# 🚀 Symfony MCP Server 1.4.0 - Unleashing Agentic Potential with Sampling

We're thrilled to announce the release of **Symfony MCP Server 1.4.0**, featuring a groundbreaking addition that transforms how your MCP tools can interact with Large Language Models. This release introduces comprehensive **Sampling Support**, enabling true agentic behavior in your Symfony applications.

## 🧠 What is Sampling and Why It Matters

Sampling is a revolutionary feature that allows your MCP tools to request LLM assistance during execution, creating a powerful feedback loop between your application logic and AI reasoning. This opens up a new paradigm of **agentic applications** where tools can:

- **Think and reason** about complex problems by consulting LLMs
- **Make intelligent decisions** based on dynamic context
- **Generate sophisticated responses** that adapt to user needs
- **Collaborate with AI** to solve problems beyond traditional tool capabilities

## 🔥 Key Features in 1.4.0

### 🎯 Comprehensive Sampling Architecture

- **`SamplingAwareToolInterface`**: Transform your tools into intelligent agents
- **`SamplingClient`**: Powerful service for managing LLM interactions
- **Model Preferences**: Fine-tune LLM selection based on cost, speed, and intelligence priorities
- **Multi-Message Conversations**: Enable complex reasoning with context preservation

### 🛠️ Smart Tool Integration

Tools implementing `SamplingAwareToolInterface` automatically receive the `SamplingClient` service, making it effortless to add AI-powered reasoning to your existing tools.

### 🎨 Flexible Sampling Types

- **Text Sampling**: Simple text-based AI requests
- **Multi-Message Sampling**: Complex conversations with preserved context
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Choose the right LLM for each task

## 🌟 Real-World Agentic Examples

### Intelligent Code Analysis
```php
class CodeAnalyzerTool implements SamplingAwareToolInterface
{
    private SamplingClient $samplingClient;

    public function execute(array $arguments): ToolResultInterface
    {
        // Check if sampling is available before using it
        if ($this->samplingClient->canSample()) {
            try {
                // Use AI to analyze code for security vulnerabilities
                $response = $this->samplingClient->createTextRequest(
                    'Analyze this code for security issues: ' . $arguments['code'],
                    new ModelPreferences(
                        [['name' => 'claude-3-sonnet']],
                        0.2, // costPriority
                        0.8, // intelligencePriority 
                        0.2  // speedPriority
                    ),
                    'You are a security expert analyzing code for vulnerabilities.',
                    2000
                );
                
                // Return the AI analysis result
                return new TextToolResult($response->getContent()->getText());
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
                // Fallback if sampling fails
                return new TextToolResult('Static analysis: Please review code manually for security issues.');
            }
        }
        
        // Fallback when sampling is not available
        return new TextToolResult('Code analysis requires AI sampling capability.');
    }
    
    public function setSamplingClient(SamplingClient $samplingClient): void
    {
        $this->samplingClient = $samplingClient;
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Content Generation
```php
class ContentGeneratorTool implements SamplingAwareToolInterface
{
    private SamplingClient $samplingClient;

    public function execute(array $arguments): ToolResultInterface
    {
        if ($this->samplingClient->canSample()) {
            try {
                // Generate personalized content using AI
                $response = $this->samplingClient->createTextRequest(
                    "Generate a blog post about {$arguments['topic']} " .
                    "targeting {$arguments['audience']} with tone: {$arguments['tone']}",
                    new ModelPreferences(
                        [['name' => 'claude-3-sonnet']],
                        0.3, // costPriority
                        0.7, // intelligencePriority
                        0.4  // speedPriority
                    ),
                    'You are a professional content writer creating engaging blog posts.',
                    1500
                );
                
                return new TextToolResult($response->getContent()->getText());
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
                return new TextToolResult('Content generation failed. Please try again.');
            }
        }
        
        return new TextToolResult('Content generation requires AI sampling capability.');
    }
    
    public function setSamplingClient(SamplingClient $samplingClient): void
    {
        $this->samplingClient = $samplingClient;
    }
}
```
